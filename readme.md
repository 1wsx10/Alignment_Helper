# Instructions

1. Make the 2 coordinates that you want to align the ship with
2. Place a Cockpit (it should be facing the direction you want to align to)
3. Place a LCD somewhere in view
4. Name the Cockpit and LCD so the program can recognise them (see defaults below)
5. Load the script into the Programmable block
6. Copy and Paste the GPS coordinates into the programmable block, it should be of the format:
GPS1&GPS2
7. Happy Aligning!
8. When done aligning, turn the programmable block off till you need it again, it runs constantly.

## Default Names

```
alignment cockpit
alignment lcd
```
You can change these by changing the text at the top of the program, this is case sensetive.


## Just the tip

you can actually delete the coordinates, all that matters is the text is in the custom data of the programmable block
